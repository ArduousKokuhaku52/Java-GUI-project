# Java-GUI-project

UPDATE 5/18/2023
This project will no longer be updated on this GitHub repo. 
The project has been moved to our organizations repo as the project now interacts with an API made with someone form the organization

The project now resides here: https://github.com/KaishiCo/Java-GUI-Application
It also now interacts with an open-source API found here: https://github.com/KaishiCo/tasks

This project is a personal project to mess with and learn making GUI interfaces with java swing. I will be periodically adding more to this as I learn more. 
The end result will hopefully be a decent interface for companies to use within their production environments
